Luminous Flux is an open souce journalism effort.
It re-imagines how long-running stories with lots of updates can be covered while still providing the full context.

Our mockups and a self-hosted version for this projects' progress information can be found at http://lflux.org/


This project is supported and financed by the Internet Foundation Austria as part of the 6th netidee [1] call.

Setup
-----

Setup a new virtualenv and run the following

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    cd lfluxproject/
    python manage.py syncdb
    python manage.py migrate

You possibly have to run the last two commands more than once if you encounter errors.
